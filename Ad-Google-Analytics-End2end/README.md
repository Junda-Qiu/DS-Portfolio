**Insights:**  
- CTR peaks in the low-price band (0â€“100) at **5.49%**, dominating user volume.  
- High-priced goods (>12,801) show a rebound, indicating **brand-driven clicks**.  
- Mid-price items yield stable performance but with diminishing sensitivity.

**Recommendations:**  
- Use **dual-tier strategy**: low-price for ROI efficiency, high-price for brand engagement.

## 4. Ad Placement & Audience Behavior  

ðŸ“Š **Figures:** `ad_top10_age.png`, `ad_bottom10_age.png`, `clicked_price.png`

High CTR ads concentrate among young-to-middle-age groups, suggesting strong creative resonance.  
Low CTR ads, despite exposure, lack contextual relevance or visual appeal.

<img width="500" height="300" alt="ad_top10_age" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c4b48d6-4da1-4f2b-98f7-f2231e2087cd" />
<img width="500" height="300" alt="ad_bottom10_age" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5d58d1f-4902-4120-9835-67d8e44f8f0c" />
<img width="500" height="300" alt="clicked_price" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5208f828-92bc-4798-a202-c81ed269a419" />


**Takeaways:**  
1. Replicate top CTR creative patterns.  
2. Replace underperforming ads or limit frequency.  
3. Cross-check age Ã— placement correlation for mismatch detection.

## 5. RFM Segmentation & Precision Strategy  

ðŸ“Š **Figure:** `rfmcluster_age.png`

| Segment | Share (%) | CTR | Avg Price | Strategic Action |
|----------|------------|-----|------------|------------------|
| Loyal Heavy Users | 26.9 | High | Mid | Exclusive loyalty rewards |
| New Users | 25.9 | Mid | Low | Welcome coupons + guidance |
| Churned Users | 18.5 | Low | High | Reactivation campaigns |
| Retention Targets | 17.2 | Mid | Mid | Renewal incentives |
| Potential Users | 4.0 | High | Mid | Personalized recommendations |
| Premium Users | 4.6 | High | High | VIP tier programs |
| Stable Users | 1.5 | Mid | Mid | Light-touch engagement |
<img width="640" height="480" alt="rfmcluster_age" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2657e10e-0de3-4b00-bc40-4e815d800e8b" />

**Key Insight:** RFM reveals clear value hierarchyâ€”top 10% users contribute most CTR.  
**Operational Focus:** Balance between reactivation (churned) and nurturing (potential).

## 6. Behavioral Clustering (K-Means)

ðŸ“Š **Figure:** `cluster_age.png`

| Cluster | Share (%) | Traits | Label |
|----------|------------|--------|--------|
| C0 | 80.1 | Low engagement, low spend | "Passive Observers" |
| C1 | 8.1 | Stable CTR, mid-price | "Rational Shoppers" |
| C2 | 2.0 | High-price, low frequency | "Brand Seekers" |
| C3 | 3.2 | High CTR, frequent | "Active Engagers" |
| C4 | 6.6 | High spend, high CTR | "High-Value Elites" |
<img width="640" height="480" alt="cluster_age" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2399e743-4e09-4779-b5e7-c79bda583c4f" />

**Recommendation:** Tailor campaigns per cluster â€” C3/C4 as top ROI groups, C0 as reactivation focus.

## 7. Retention & Cohort Analysis  

ðŸ“Š **Figure:** `cohort_retention_heatmap.png`

| Period | Retention (%) |
|---------|----------------|
| 7-Day | 2.46 |
| 14-Day | 0.00 |
| 30-Day | 0.00 |
<img width="600" height="300" alt="cohort_retention_heatmap" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/08f8ca26-dc06-4482-bbf6-d1c70976514e" />

**Interpretation:** Retention drops steeply after day 7, reflecting lack of post-click engagement.  
**Action Plan:** Implement automated push cycles at D+1 / D+3 / D+7 intervals.

## 8. Price Sensitivity: Equal-Width vs Quantile Binning  

ðŸ“Š **Figure:** `price_ctr_equalwidth.png`
<img width="500" height="300" alt="price_ctr_equalwidth" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d92b0ae-6926-4d24-9ffd-35767c6b2792" />

Equal-width binning skews CTR toward low bands due to outliers.  
Quantile-based bins yield a more realistic representation of click behavior.

**Best Practice:** Prefer quantile segmentation for CTR-related reporting.

## 9. Strategic Recommendations

| Layer | Focus | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Advertising | Budget optimization | Reallocate to high-CTR placements |
| User | Segmentation | Build RFM-driven cohorts |
| Retention | Lifecycle triggers | D+1/D+3/D+7 push model |
| Pricing | Dual-tier strategy | ROI + brand split |
| Data | Metric governance | Standardize fields and ROI tracking |
