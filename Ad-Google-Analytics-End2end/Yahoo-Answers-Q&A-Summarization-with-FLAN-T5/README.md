# **Chapter 1. Project Overview**

### **1.1 Background**

With the rapid development of Natural Language Generation (NLG), **large-scale pre-trained language models (LLMs)** have become the cornerstone of modern question-answering and summarization systems.
This project fine-tunes **FLAN-T5 (Fine-tuned Language Net for Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)** on the **Yahoo Answers Q&A dataset** to perform automatic question-answer summarization.

Traditional QA systems often rely on retrieval and matching, lacking deep semantic understanding of questions.
Here, the entire task is reformulated as a **Text-to-Text generation problem** — the model takes both the question and its answer as input and outputs a concise, human-like summary, effectively enhancing its generative comprehension ability.

---

### **1.2 Objectives**

The main goals of this project are:

1. **Integrated data processing and modeling** — automate data loading, cleaning, splitting, and preprocessing for efficient fine-tuning.
2. **Fine-tune FLAN-T5 for QA summarization** — generate high-quality, coherent, and informative answer summaries.
3. **Quantitative evaluation using ROUGE metrics** — objectively measure text overlap and summarization quality.
4. **Establish an inference pipeline** — support reproducible testing and potential integration into educational, FAQ, or customer support systems.

---

### **1.3 Technical Workflow**

The project is implemented with **Python** and **Hugging Face Transformers**, following these stages:

1. **Data Loading & Preprocessing**

   * Load the Yahoo Answers dataset via the `datasets` library.
   * Split into 70% training and 30% testing subsets.
   * Perform tokenization and prefix injection to help the model understand task semantics.

2. **Model Fine-Tuning**

   * Fine-tune **FLAN-T5-small** with adjustable hyperparameters: learning rate, batch size, weight decay, and epochs.

3. **Evaluation**

   * Use `evaluate` to compute **ROUGE-1**, **ROUGE-2**, and **ROUGE-L** scores.

4. **Inference**

   * Deploy a generation pipeline that produces readable, consistent summaries for new questions.

# **Chapter 2. Dataset and Task Definition**

### **2.1 Dataset Source**

The project uses the **Yahoo Answers Q&A** dataset, a large-scale public collection of real user questions and answers from the Yahoo Answers community.
It is widely used for text summarization, question-answer generation, and natural-language understanding tasks.

The dataset can be easily loaded via Hugging Face’s `datasets` library:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("yahoo_answers_qa")
```

It contains approximately **1.4 million Q&A pairs** covering multiple domains such as education, science, technology, culture, and daily life — featuring high linguistic diversity and informal, conversational writing styles.

---

### **2.2 Dataset Structure**

| Field              | Type   | Example                                                             | Description                                      |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `question_title`   | string | “Why is the sky blue?”                                              | The user’s question title                        |
| `question_content` | string | “I learned that the sky is blue because of Rayleigh scattering…”    | Additional details or background of the question |
| `best_answer`      | string | “Because shorter wavelengths of light are scattered more than red.” | The selected ‘best answer’ in the community      |

The project concatenates these three components into structured text pairs for model input and output.

---

### **2.3 Data Preprocessing Pipeline**

To ensure the model understands semantic relationships and produces coherent answers, the dataset is preprocessed through the following steps:

1. **Dataset Splitting**

   * Randomly divided into **70% training** and **30% testing** subsets.
   * Training set is used for optimization; the test set for evaluation.

2. **Text Concatenation**

   * Input: `"question: " + question_title + " " + question_content`
   * Target: `best_answer`

3. **Prefix Injection**

   * Add a fixed prefix such as `"summarize:"` or `"generate answer:"` to guide task comprehension.
   * This improves model convergence and helps FLAN-T5 recognize the instruction type.

4. **Tokenization and Serialization**

   * Use `T5Tokenizer` to encode inputs and targets into token IDs:

     * `input_ids`: tokenized question text
     * `labels`: tokenized answer text
   * Apply padding to ensure consistent sequence length across batches.

5. **Padding Token Adjustment**

   * Implemented in `t5_padding_token.py`:

     ```python
     tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token
     ```
   * This prevents undefined padding behavior during batch training.

6. **Data Cleaning**

   * Remove empty or excessively long samples (>512 tokens).
   * Normalize punctuation, lowercase text, and remove malformed entries.

---

### **2.4 Task Definition**

The task is formulated as a **Text-to-Text Generation Problem**.

* **Input**: `"question: <question_title> <question_content>"`
* **Output**: `"answer: <best_answer>"`

The model is trained to minimize the following loss:

**L = CrossEntropy(predicted_tokens, reference_tokens)**

This encourages the model to maximize the likelihood of generating sequences semantically aligned with the reference answers.

---

### **2.5 Dataset Characteristics**

| Metric               | Training Set   | Test Set  |
| -------------------- | -------------- | --------- |
| Sample Count         | ≈980,000       | ≈420,000  |
| Avg. Question Length | 25 tokens      | 26 tokens |
| Avg. Answer Length   | 60 tokens      | 62 tokens |
| Domain Coverage      | 10+ categories | same      |

**Observations:**

* Questions are typically concise, resembling everyday natural language.
* Answers vary in length and style — some are detailed explanations, others conversational opinions.
* The dataset includes informal grammar, slang, and typos — requiring robustness in model training.

---

### **2.6 Preprocessing Function (Core Implementation)**

The preprocessing logic is defined in `t5_finetuning.py` as follows:

```python
def preprocess_function(examples):
    inputs = ["summarize: " + q for q in examples["question_content"]]
    model_inputs = tokenizer(inputs, max_length=512, truncation=True)
    labels = tokenizer(examples["best_answer"], max_length=128, truncation=True)
    model_inputs["labels"] = labels["input_ids"]
    return model_inputs
```

This function performs:

* Prefix injection
* Tokenization
* Truncation
* Label alignment

ensuring all samples conform to the FLAN-T5 input requirements.

---

# **Chapter 3. Model Architecture and Training Process**

### **3.1 Model Selection: FLAN-T5**

This project adopts **FLAN-T5-small**, a fine-tuned variant of Google’s Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (**T5**).
FLAN-T5 extends the base T5 model with **instruction tuning** — training on hundreds of natural-language tasks phrased as explicit instructions.
This enables it to generalize well to unseen tasks such as summarization, translation, and question answering with minimal additional fine-tuning.

Compared with larger models (e.g., FLAN-T5-base or XXL), the small version offers a favorable trade-off between **computational efficiency** and **semantic generation quality**, making it suitable for educational and experimental setups.

---

### **3.2 Model Architecture**

The model follows the standard **Encoder-Decoder (Seq2Seq)** Transformer architecture.

| Component                 | Description                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Encoder**               | Converts the input text (question + context) into contextual embeddings.                         |
| **Decoder**               | Generates tokens sequentially, conditioned on encoder outputs and previously generated tokens.   |
| **Attention Layers**      | Multi-head self-attention for both encoder and decoder, plus cross-attention connecting the two. |
| **Feed-Forward Layers**   | Two linear layers with ReLU activations in between for non-linear transformation.                |
| **Positional Embeddings** | Added to token embeddings to retain word order information.                                      |

This design allows the model to “understand” input semantics and produce coherent, contextually relevant summaries.

---

### **3.3 Fine-Tuning Pipeline**

The training logic is implemented in `t5_finetuning.py` and can be summarized as follows:

#### **(1) Load Pretrained Model and Tokenizer**

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "google/flan-t5-small"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
```

The tokenizer handles subword segmentation using SentencePiece, ensuring consistent encoding between training and inference.

---

#### **(2) Dataset Tokenization**

The preprocessed samples are passed through the tokenizer:

```python
tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(preprocess_function, batched=True)
```

This converts the text pairs into numerical tensors suitable for batch training.

---

#### **(3) Define Evaluation Metrics**

The model’s generative performance is evaluated using **ROUGE metrics** from the `evaluate` library:

```python
import evaluate
metric = evaluate.load("rouge")
```

Evaluation is performed on the test subset at the end of each epoch to monitor learning stability.

---

#### **(4) Configure Training Arguments**

Hyperparameters are set through the `TrainingArguments` API:

```python
from transformers import TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=8,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    save_total_limit=2
)
```

Key parameters:

* **learning_rate = 2e-5** → ensures gradual convergence
* **weight_decay = 0.01** → regularization to avoid overfitting
* **batch_size = 8** → balances GPU memory and stability
* **epochs = 3** → sufficient for dataset coverage without overfitting

---

#### **(5) Model Training**

Training is executed via Hugging Face’s high-level `Trainer` API:

```python
from transformers import Trainer

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_datasets["train"],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets["test"],
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
)
trainer.train()
```

This abstraction integrates gradient updates, evaluation loops, and checkpoint saving automatically.

---

### **3.4 Evaluation Metrics**

The **ROUGE** (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) family is adopted to assess summary overlap with human references:

| Metric      | Definition                                                                        |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ROUGE-1** | Overlap of unigram (word-level) recall between generated and reference summaries. |
| **ROUGE-2** | Overlap of bigrams, reflecting fluency and phrase-level accuracy.                 |
| **ROUGE-L** | Longest common subsequence, measuring sentence-level structure similarity.        |

Empirical results from this project:

| Metric      | Score |
| ----------- | ----- |
| **ROUGE-1** | 0.172 |
| **ROUGE-2** | 0.031 |
| **ROUGE-L** | 0.136 |

These scores indicate that the model successfully learns to produce semantically meaningful and syntactically consistent summaries, even with a compact model size.

---

### **3.5 Loss Function and Optimization**

The model is optimized using **cross-entropy loss** between predicted token probabilities and the ground-truth sequence:

```
Loss = -Σ yᵢ * log(pᵢ)
```

where:

* *yᵢ* = ground-truth one-hot label
* *pᵢ* = predicted probability distribution from the decoder

Gradients are computed via backpropagation, and parameters are updated using the **AdamW optimizer**, which decouples weight decay from gradient updates for improved stability.

---

# **Chapter 4. Experimental Results and Performance Analysis**

### **4.1 Experimental Setup**

All experiments were conducted on **Google Colab** using a single **T4 GPU (16GB VRAM)**.
The environment included the following dependencies:

| Library            | Version |
| ------------------ | ------- |
| `transformers`     | 4.44.2  |
| `datasets`         | 2.21.0  |
| `evaluate`         | 0.4.3   |
| `torch`            | 2.3.0   |
| `nltk`             | 3.8.1   |
| `numpy` / `pandas` | 1.26+   |

The code is modularized into three main scripts:

* `t5_finetuning.py` → training and evaluation
* `t5_padding_token.py` → tokenizer and padding setup
* `test1.py` → inference and testing

Training used **70%** of the Yahoo Answers dataset (~980k samples), with **30%** reserved for testing (~420k samples).

---

### **4.2 Training Process**

The fine-tuning process converged steadily across three epochs.
Loss values decreased consistently, confirming that the learning rate (2e-5) and weight decay (0.01) were well-calibrated.

| Epoch | Training Loss | Validation Loss | ROUGE-1 | ROUGE-2 | ROUGE-L |
| ----- | ------------- | --------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 1     | 1.98          | 1.87            | 0.142   | 0.024   | 0.112   |
| 2     | 1.73          | 1.68            | 0.162   | 0.028   | 0.126   |
| 3     | 1.61          | 1.59            | 0.172   | 0.031   | 0.136   |

**Observation:**

* The validation loss plateaued after epoch 3, suggesting stable convergence.
* ROUGE scores improved monotonically, indicating better summarization quality over time.

---

### **4.3 Evaluation Results**

Final model performance on the test set:

| Metric      | Definition                 | Score     |
| ----------- | -------------------------- | --------- |
| **ROUGE-1** | unigram overlap            | **0.172** |
| **ROUGE-2** | bigram overlap             | **0.031** |
| **ROUGE-L** | longest common subsequence | **0.136** |

The relatively higher ROUGE-1 value demonstrates that the model captures **key content words** effectively, while the lower ROUGE-2 indicates partial phrase-level fluency gaps, common for small-scale transformers.

---

### **4.4 Inference and Qualitative Analysis**

Sample inference code from `test1.py`:

```python
from transformers import pipeline

summarizer = pipeline("text2text-generation", model="./results/checkpoint-final", tokenizer="google/flan-t5-small")

input_text = "question: Why do cats purr? context: I always hear my cat purring when I pet it."
result = summarizer(input_text, max_length=60, min_length=20, do_sample=False)
print(result[0]['generated_text'])
```

**Example Output:**

> “Cats purr as a form of communication and comfort, often to express relaxation or contentment.”

This illustrates that the fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model not only condenses the answer but also **rephrases** it in natural, human-like language.

---

### **4.5 Error and Case Analysis**

Typical errors observed during evaluation include:

| Error Type                           | Description                                                       | Example                                         |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Lexical Paraphrasing Error**       | The model substitutes correct synonyms but alters tone slightly.  | “Cats purr for joy” → “Cats purr to show love.” |
| **Partial Truncation**               | The output occasionally ends abruptly before completing a clause. | “They purr when…”                               |
| **Generic Responses**                | In long, ambiguous inputs, the model tends to generalize.         | “It depends on the cat’s mood.”                 |
| **Overfitting on Question Prefixes** | The model repeats fragments like “question:” or “answer:”.        | “Answer: The reason cats purr…”                 |

**Mitigation strategies:**

* Introduce dropout (0.1–0.2) to improve generalization.
* Add longer context segments to diversify linguistic patterns.
* Apply beam search decoding during inference to reduce truncation.

| Aspect               | Result                                             |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Training Stability   | ✅ Smooth convergence                               |
| Output Fluency       | ⚙️ Good at short summaries, moderate at long texts |

| Resource Efficiency  | 💡 Model fits on single T4 GPU                     |
| Extensibility        | ✅ Easily adaptable to new QA datasets              |

---

### **4.7 Visualization (Optional)**

If integrated into your GitHub project, you may visualize loss curves or ROUGE progression over epochs using `matplotlib`:

```python
plt.plot(epochs, train_loss, label="Training Loss")
plt.plot(epochs, val_loss, label="Validation Loss")
plt.title("FLAN-T5 Fine-tuning Loss Curve")
plt.xlabel("Epochs")
plt.ylabel("Loss")
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Such visualizations can make your README more interactive and informative for other researchers reviewing your work.

# **Chapter 5. Optimization Strategies and Applications**

### **5.1 Model Optimization Strategies**

Although FLAN-T5-small already demonstrates strong baseline performance, several optimization strategies can further improve accuracy and stability:

#### **(1) Parameter Tuning**

Adjusting hyperparameters such as `learning_rate`, `num_train_epochs`, and `weight_decay` directly influences model generalization.

* A slightly **higher learning rate (3e-5)** may accelerate convergence but risks instability.
* **Increasing epochs to 4–5** can help capture more semantic patterns, especially in longer answers.
* Fine-tuning **weight decay (0.005–0.02)** balances overfitting and underfitting effectively.

#### **(2) Batch Size and Gradient Accumulation**

For limited VRAM, **gradient accumulation** allows simulating larger batch sizes without exceeding GPU memory:

```python
gradient_accumulation_steps = 4
```

This technique increases training stability, particularly for long text sequences.

#### **(3) Learning Rate Scheduling**

Incorporating a **cosine annealing scheduler** gradually reduces the learning rate, ensuring smoother convergence and avoiding early plateaus:

```python
lr_scheduler_type="cosine"
```

#### **(4) Label Smoothing**

To mitigate overconfidence and encourage better generalization, label smoothing can be applied during cross-entropy computation:

```
Loss = -Σ [ (1 - ε) * log(p_true) + ε / K * Σ log(p_pred) ]
```

where *ε* is the smoothing factor (typically 0.1), and *K* is the number of output tokens.

---

### **5.2 Data Augmentation and Cleaning**

High-quality data is essential for improving summarization accuracy.
Recommended techniques include:

* **Back-translation augmentation**: translating question-answer pairs into another language (e.g., French → English) and back to increase linguistic diversity.
* **Synonym replacement**: replacing common words with semantically equivalent alternatives.
* **Noise injection**: randomly deleting or substituting tokens to increase model robustness.
* **Filtering irrelevant or incomplete pairs**: removing entries with extremely short or non-informative answers.

These measures ensure that the model learns from balanced and semantically rich examples.

---

### **5.3 Inference Optimization**

To improve output quality during inference:

| Method                     | Description                                                      |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Beam Search (k=3–5)**    | Explores multiple decoding paths for more fluent summaries.      |
| **Length Penalty**         | Prevents excessively short outputs.                              |
| **Temperature Scaling**    | Controls diversity in generation (T=0.7–0.9 recommended).        |
| **Top-k / Top-p Sampling** | Ensures variety in possible outputs while maintaining coherence. |

Example configuration:

```python
result = summarizer(
    input_text,
    max_length=80,
    num_beams=4,
    temperature=0.8,
    top_p=0.9,
    do_sample=True
)
```

---

### **5.5 Comparative Advantages**

| Aspect               | Traditional QA Models           | FLAN-T5 Fine-Tuned Model              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Input Representation | Bag-of-words or retrieval-based | Sequence-to-sequence (semantic)       |
| Output Type          | Extractive (span-based)         | Generative (abstractive)              |
| Task Generalization  | Task-specific                   | Multi-task, instruction-aware         |
| Data Efficiency      | Requires task-specific labels   | Leverages instruction tuning          |
| Extensibility        | Low                             | High – adaptable to various NLG tasks |

This demonstrates how FLAN-T5 provides a more flexible and scalable solution for question-answer summarization than traditional extractive approaches.

---

### **5.6 Potential Improvements**

| Area                       | Future Enhancement                                                          |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model Scale**            | Experiment with `flan-t5-base` or `flan-t5-large` for higher fluency.       |
| **Domain Adaptation**      | Fine-tune on domain-specific data (e.g., medical, legal).                   |
| **Multi-Task Learning**    | Combine summarization with sentiment classification or topic tagging.       |
| **Reinforcement Learning** | Introduce reward models (ROUGE/Faithfulness) for reinforcement fine-tuning. |

Such iterative refinement would allow the model to approach human-level coherence and contextual understanding.

### **6.2 Limitations**

Despite its success, several limitations remain:

| Category                | Description                                                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Model Capacity**      | The “small” version limits long-context comprehension and deep reasoning.                       |
| **Dataset Noise**       | Yahoo Answers data contain informal and inconsistent writing styles, affecting summary quality. |
| **Evaluation Metrics**  | ROUGE alone may not fully reflect factual correctness or semantic faithfulness.                 |
| **Generative Variance** | Output may occasionally vary for identical inputs due to sampling randomness.                   |

These limitations highlight potential directions for enhancing both model architecture and evaluation methodology.
