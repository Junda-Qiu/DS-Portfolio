## 3. CTR & Price Tier Analysis  

ðŸ“Š **Figures:** `ctr_by_pricebin.png`, `usershare_by_pricebin.png`

| Price Bin | CTR (%) | User Share (%) |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| 0â€“100 | **5.49** | **51.07** |
| 101â€“200 | 4.62 | 31.29 |
| 201â€“400 | 4.68 | 29.80 |
| 401â€“800 | 4.60 | 17.07 |
| 801â€“1600 | 4.45 | 10.87 |
| 1601â€“3200 | 4.20 | 7.19 |
| 3201â€“6400 | 4.17 | 4.99 |
| 6401â€“12800 | 4.38 | 2.86 |
| 12801+ | 5.13 | 1.23 |

**Insights:**  
- CTR peaks in the low-price band (0â€“100) at **5.49%**, dominating user volume.  
- High-priced goods (>12,801) show a rebound, indicating **brand-driven clicks**.  
- Mid-price items yield stable performance but with diminishing sensitivity.

**Recommendations:**  
- Use **dual-tier strategy**: low-price for ROI efficiency, high-price for brand engagement.

## 4. Ad Placement & Audience Behavior  

ðŸ“Š **Figures:** `ad_top10_age.png`, `ad_bottom10_age.png`, `clicked_price.png`

High CTR ads concentrate among young-to-middle-age groups, suggesting strong creative resonance.  
Low CTR ads, despite exposure, lack contextual relevance or visual appeal.

**Takeaways:**  
1. Replicate top CTR creative patterns.  
2. Replace underperforming ads or limit frequency.  
3. Cross-check age Ã— placement correlation for mismatch detection.

## 5. RFM Segmentation & Precision Strategy  

ðŸ“Š **Figure:** `rfmcluster_age.png`

| Segment | Share (%) | CTR | Avg Price | Strategic Action |
|----------|------------|-----|------------|------------------|
| Loyal Heavy Users | 26.9 | High | Mid | Exclusive loyalty rewards |
| New Users | 25.9 | Mid | Low | Welcome coupons + guidance |
| Churned Users | 18.5 | Low | High | Reactivation campaigns |
| Retention Targets | 17.2 | Mid | Mid | Renewal incentives |
| Potential Users | 4.0 | High | Mid | Personalized recommendations |
| Premium Users | 4.6 | High | High | VIP tier programs |
| Stable Users | 1.5 | Mid | Mid | Light-touch engagement |

**Key Insight:** RFM reveals clear value hierarchyâ€”top 10% users contribute most CTR.  
**Operational Focus:** Balance between reactivation (churned) and nurturing (potential).

## 6. Behavioral Clustering (K-Means)

ðŸ“Š **Figure:** `cluster_age.png`

| Cluster | Share (%) | Traits | Label |
|----------|------------|--------|--------|
| C0 | 80.1 | Low engagement, low spend | "Passive Observers" |
| C1 | 8.1 | Stable CTR, mid-price | "Rational Shoppers" |
| C2 | 2.0 | High-price, low frequency | "Brand Seekers" |
| C3 | 3.2 | High CTR, frequent | "Active Engagers" |
| C4 | 6.6 | High spend, high CTR | "High-Value Elites" |

**Recommendation:** Tailor campaigns per cluster â€” C3/C4 as top ROI groups, C0 as reactivation focus.

---

## 7. Retention & Cohort Analysis  

ðŸ“Š **Figure:** `cohort_retention_heatmap.png`

| Period | Retention (%) |
|---------|----------------|
| 7-Day | 2.46 |
| 14-Day | 0.00 |
| 30-Day | 0.00 |

**Interpretation:** Retention drops steeply after day 7, reflecting lack of post-click engagement.  
**Action Plan:** Implement automated push cycles at D+1 / D+3 / D+7 intervals.

---

## 8. Price Sensitivity: Equal-Width vs Quantile Binning  

ðŸ“Š **Figure:** `price_ctr_equalwidth.png`

Equal-width binning skews CTR toward low bands due to outliers.  
Quantile-based bins yield a more realistic representation of click behavior.

**Best Practice:** Prefer quantile segmentation for CTR-related reporting.

---

## 9. Strategic Recommendations

| Layer | Focus | Action |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Advertising | Budget optimization | Reallocate to high-CTR placements |
| User | Segmentation | Build RFM-driven cohorts |
| Retention | Lifecycle triggers | D+1/D+3/D+7 push model |
| Pricing | Dual-tier strategy | ROI + brand split |
| Data | Metric governance | Standardize fields and ROI tracking |

## 10. Project Impact & Future Work  

This project establishes a reusable analytical framework for ad performance optimization.  

**Next Steps:**  
1. Integrate cost and order data for ROI computation.  
2. Deploy predictive CTR models (LightGBM / XGBoost).  
3. Automate visualization via Streamlit dashboard.  
4. Conduct A/B testing for strategy validation.

**Business Value:**  
- For Platforms: Quantitative basis for ad placement tuning.  
- For Advertisers: Budget and targeting guidance.
