## <big>**💼 Professional Experience**</big>

### **GoDaddy** — *Machine Learning Engineer Intern*

📍 Tempe, AZ | 07.2025 – 09.2025

> Designed and deployed large-scale ML infrastructure enabling intelligent domain search and pricing automation through LLM–tool integration.

* Designed and deployed **DeepSpin-based semantic keyword generation pipeline**, containerized with Docker and served under a secure **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** architecture.
* Built a **production MCP server** exposing unified ML tools (domain search, pricing, discount prediction) to LLMs for **agent orchestration** and **cross-system scalability**.
* Developed an **end-to-end inference system** connecting domain models with **real-time pricing APIs** and **AWS Athena discount prediction**, optimizing conversion by dynamically learning from shopper and domain keyword histories.
* Created an **intelligent conversational sales agent** integrating availability checking, pricing queries, and personalized recommendations — improving engagement by **35%** and reducing average search time by **2.3 minutes** per session.
