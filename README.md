## 💼 Professional Experience

### GoDaddy — *Machine Learning Engineer Intern*  
📍 Tempe, AZ | **07.2025 – 09.2025**

- Designed and deployed **DeepSpin-based semantic keyword expansion pipelines**, containerized with Docker and served via secure HTTPS MCP (Model Context Protocol) architecture.  
- Built a **production-grade MCP server** exposing unified ML tools (domain search, pricing, discount prediction) to LLMs, improving scalability and interoperability.  
- Developed an **end-to-end inference pipeline** connecting domain search models with real-time pricing APIs and AWS Athena-based discount prediction.  
- Created an **intelligent conversational sales agent** that enhanced engagement by **35%** and reduced search time by **2.3 minutes per session**.

### Google — *Data Scientist Intern (Python, SQL, AI Technology)*  
📍 Remote | **01.2025 – 03.2025**

- Conducted **user segmentation** with K-Means clustering and RFM modeling, improving engagement by **10%**.  
- Analyzed **10,000+ ad records**, optimizing cost-per-click and reducing ad inefficiency by **15%**.  
- Applied the **AARRR growth model** to evaluate conversion funnel stages and enhance retention.
