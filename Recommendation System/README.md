# **Chapter 1. Project Overview**

### **1.1 Research Background**

With the rapid development of e-commerce and content recommendation platforms, recommendation algorithms have become one of the most valuable real-world applications of artificial intelligence.
In large-scale ecosystems such as **Amazon**, **Netflix**, and **YouTube**, recommendation systems not only influence users’ purchasing decisions but also directly determine conversion rates, retention, and user satisfaction.

This project focuses on the **Amazon public recommendation dataset** and systematically explores both traditional machine learning and deep learning algorithms.
By implementing and comparing four representative models — **BPRMF (Bayesian Personalized Ranking Matrix Factorization)**, **ItemKNN (Item-based Collaborative Filtering)**, **DeepFM (Deep Factorization Machine)**, and **LightGCN (Light Graph Convolutional Network)** — the study investigates the trade-offs between accuracy, recall, scalability, and interpretability.
The final goal is to establish a **hybrid, industrial-grade recommendation framework** that balances efficiency and personalization.

### **1.2 Research Objectives**

The core objective of this project is:

> To evaluate and compare multiple mainstream recommendation algorithms under a unified experimental setting, analyzing their differences in **Recall@K**, **NDCG@K**, and overall system performance, in order to design an optimized recommendation system architecture.

Specific objectives include:

1. **Data Pipeline Development** — Design a unified data extraction and feature engineering workflow (Pandas + Spark) to automate the transformation from raw user–item interactions to model-ready features.
2. **Model Implementation** — Implement four representative algorithms covering matrix factorization, neighborhood-based filtering, feature-interaction networks, and graph neural networks.
3. **Experimental Evaluation** — Use cross-validation to fine-tune hyperparameters and evaluate model performance with standardized metrics (Recall@10, NDCG@10).
4. **System Integration** — Summarize each model’s trade-offs in scalability, interpretability, and computation cost, proposing a hybrid framework suitable for real-world deployment.

# **Chapter 2. Dataset and Preprocessing**

### **2.1 Dataset Overview**

This project uses the **Amazon Product Review Dataset (Movie & Video subset)** as the primary data source.
The dataset contains large-scale user–item interaction records, including ratings, timestamps, and product metadata.
Given its high dimensionality and sparsity, the preprocessing stage focuses on **data structuring, noise removal, and efficient sampling** to ensure consistent performance across models.

**Key Statistics:**

| Metric             | Value                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Total Users        | 255,404                                           |
| Total Items        | 255,404                                           |
| Interactions       | ~3.6 million                                      |
| Sparsity           | ≈ 99.45%                                          |
| Feature Dimensions | User ID, Item ID, Rating, Timestamp, Category Tag |

---

### **2.2 Data Characteristics and Challenges**

1. **High Sparsity**
   Most users interact with only a small subset of items, making it difficult for collaborative models to capture global preferences.

2. **Long-Tail Distribution**
   A few popular items dominate most interactions, while the majority of items have minimal exposure, leading to popularity bias.

3. **Heterogeneous Feature Requirements**
   Different models (e.g., BPRMF vs. DeepFM) require varying input formats — from simple user–item pairs to structured feature tensors.

4. **Temporal Dimension**
   Interaction timestamps provide an opportunity to model user interest evolution over time.

---

### **2.3 Data Cleaning and Feature Construction**

To ensure comparability and reusability across models, a unified preprocessing pipeline was developed, compatible with both **Pandas** and **PySpark**.

```
Raw Data → Noise Removal → ID Mapping → Sparse Matrix Construction → Tensor Conversion
```

**Step-by-step workflow:**

#### (1) Deduplication and Outlier Filtering

* Remove duplicate interactions.
* Filter out invalid ratings (negative or >5).
* Exclude inactive users (<3 interactions) and infrequent items (<5 interactions).

#### (2) ID Encoding

Convert user and item IDs into numeric indices compatible with PyTorch tensors:

```python
user2id = {uid: idx for idx, uid in enumerate(unique_users)}
item2id = {iid: idx for idx, iid in enumerate(unique_items)}
```

#### (3) Sparse Matrix Construction

User–item matrix representation:

|       | Item1 | Item2 | Item3 | ... |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | --- |
| User1 | 1     | 0     | 1     | ... |
| User2 | 0     | 1     | 0     | ... |

`1` = interaction exists, `0` = no interaction.

#### (4) Negative Sampling (for BPRMF / LightGCN)

Each positive sample is paired with `n_neg=4` randomly chosen negative samples:

```python
neg_item = random.choice(all_items - user_interacted_items)
```

This improves ranking-based learning efficiency.

#### (5) Embedding Preparation (for DeepFM)

Convert categorical features into dense embeddings:

```python
user_emb = Embedding(num_users, emb_dim)
item_emb = Embedding(num_items, emb_dim)
```

---

### **2.4 Data Splitting Strategy**

Data is split in an **8:1:1 ratio** for training, validation, and testing:

* **Training Set (80%)** — parameter learning
* **Validation Set (10%)** — hyperparameter tuning
* **Test Set (10%)** — final evaluation

To maintain temporal consistency, data is sorted chronologically and split by timestamp:

```
Chronological sort → last 10% as test set → remaining 10% as validation
```

---

### **2.5 Feature Engineering**

#### (1) User-Level Features

* Interaction frequency and average rating
* Category distribution of consumed items
* Recency-based temporal activity features

#### (2) Item-Level Features

* Popularity (number of interactions)
* Average rating
* Category encoding

#### (3) Interaction-Level Features

* User–item co-occurrence frequency
* Temporal decay weighting (recent interactions weighted higher)

---

### **2.6 Automated Preprocessing System (PySpark Integration)**

A scalable Spark-based pipeline automates data cleaning and indexing:

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("AmazonRecSys").getOrCreate()
df = spark.read.csv("amazon_dataset.csv", header=True)
cleaned = df.dropDuplicates().filter(df['rating'] > 0)
indexed = StringIndexer(
    inputCols=['userID', 'itemID'],
    outputCols=['user_idx', 'item_idx']
)
```

**Advantages:**

* Distributed processing for millions of records
* Adaptable for multiple model types
* Enables integration with future batch pipelines (Airflow, HDFS)

### **3.1 Overview of Model Frameworks**

This project systematically implements and compares **four mainstream recommendation algorithms**, each representing a different stage in the evolution of recommendation system design:

| Model        | Category                | Core Idea                                                           | Implementation File |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **BPRMF**    | Matrix Factorization    | Learns user preference through pairwise ranking optimization        | `MF.py`             |
| **ItemKNN**  | Collaborative Filtering | Measures similarity between items based on user interaction history | `ItemKNN.py`        |
| **DeepFM**   | Deep Neural Model       | Integrates explicit and implicit feature interactions               | `DeepFM.py`         |
| **LightGCN** | Graph Neural Network    | Models high-order connectivity in user–item graphs                  | `LightGCN.py`       |

Each model is built under a **unified PyTorch framework**, sharing the same data loading pipeline, evaluation metrics, and training loop for consistency.

---

### **3.2 BPRMF — Bayesian Personalized Ranking Matrix Factorization**

#### **3.2.1 Theoretical Background**

The **BPRMF (Bayesian Personalized Ranking)** model learns from implicit feedback (e.g., clicks, views) rather than explicit ratings.
It assumes that a user *u* prefers item *i* over item *j* if *i* was interacted with and *j* was not.

The objective function maximizes the posterior probability of the correct ranking:

```
maximize Σ ln σ( r_ui - r_uj )
```

where:

* `r_ui = uᵀv_i` represents the preference score of user *u* for item *i*,
* σ is the sigmoid activation ensuring smooth ranking optimization.

#### **3.2.2 Implementation Highlights**

* **Embedding Layer:**

  ```python
  self.user_emb = nn.Embedding(num_users, emb_dim)
  self.item_emb = nn.Embedding(num_items, emb_dim)
  ```
* **Loss Function:**

  ```python
  loss = -torch.mean(torch.log(torch.sigmoid(pos_score - neg_score)))
  ```
* **Optimization:** Adam optimizer with learning rate = 0.001, weight decay = 1e-5.
* **Regularization:** L2 norm applied to prevent overfitting.

#### **3.2.3 Model Advantages**

* Low computational complexity.
* Strong interpretability of user–item embeddings.
* Performs well with moderate data sparsity.

---

### **3.3 ItemKNN — Item-based Collaborative Filtering**

#### **3.3.1 Principle**

The **ItemKNN** algorithm calculates item–item similarity based on co-interaction patterns:

```
sim(i, j) = |U(i) ∩ U(j)| / sqrt(|U(i)| * |U(j)|)
```

where *U(i)* denotes the set of users who interacted with item *i*.

The top *K* similar items are used to predict a user’s preference for a new item.

#### **3.3.2 Implementation Highlights**

* Construct item–user interaction matrix `M (items × users)`.
* Compute similarity matrix via cosine similarity or Jaccard index.
* Aggregate predictions:

  ```python
  score_u_i = Σ_k sim(i, k) * r_u_k
  ```
* Use top-K (default `K=40`) for final scoring.

#### **3.3.3 Model Strengths**

* **Highly interpretable:** results are easy to explain.
* **Lightweight:** no training phase required.
* **Effective for dense datasets**, though performance drops with high sparsity.

---

### **3.4 DeepFM — Deep Factorization Machine**

#### **3.4.1 Conceptual Foundation**

**DeepFM** combines two complementary components:

1. **FM (Factorization Machine):** Captures explicit low-order feature interactions.
2. **DNN (Deep Neural Network):** Learns implicit high-order nonlinear feature interactions.

The output prediction can be represented as:

```
ŷ = sigmoid( y_FM + y_DNN )
```

#### **3.4.2 Model Structure**

```
Input Layer → Embedding Layer → FM Interaction Layer → Deep Neural Network → Output Layer
```

**Key Implementation:**

```python
linear_part = self.linear(x)
fm_part = torch.sum(torch.pow(torch.sum(embed_x, 1), 2) - torch.sum(torch.pow(embed_x, 2), 1), 1) / 2
deep_part = self.deep_layers(embed_x)
output = torch.sigmoid(linear_part + fm_part + deep_part)
```

#### **3.4.3 Training Configuration**

| Parameter     | Value         |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Embedding Dim | 32            |
| Hidden Layers | [128, 64, 32] |
| Activation    | ReLU          |
| Optimizer     | Adam          |
| Learning Rate | 0.001         |
| Dropout       | 0.5           |

#### **3.4.4 Model Insights**

* **Strengths:**

  * Captures complex feature interactions without manual feature crossing.
  * Suitable for hybrid (categorical + continuous) input spaces.
* **Limitations:**

  * High memory and computation cost.
  * Slower convergence compared to simpler models.

---

### **3.5 LightGCN — Light Graph Convolutional Network**

#### **3.5.1 Core Idea**

**LightGCN** simplifies traditional GCNs by removing feature transformation and nonlinear activation, focusing purely on the graph propagation mechanism.

Node embeddings are iteratively updated as:

```
e_u^(k+1) = Σ_v∈N(u) (1 / sqrt(|N(u)| * |N(v)|)) * e_v^(k)
```

where *N(u)* denotes the set of items connected to user *u*.

Final embeddings are computed as the **average of all layers**:

```
e_u = (1 / (K+1)) * Σ_k e_u^(k)
```

#### **3.5.2 Implementation Highlights**

```python
for layer in range(self.num_layers):
    embeddings = torch.sparse.mm(adj_matrix, embeddings)
    all_embeddings.append(embeddings)
final_embeddings = torch.mean(torch.stack(all_embeddings, dim=0), dim=0)
```

#### **3.5.3 Hyperparameters**

| Parameter           | Value    |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| Embedding Dimension | 64       |
| Layers              | 3        |
| Learning Rate       | 0.001    |
| Weight Decay        | 1e-5     |
| Optimizer           | Adam     |
| Loss Function       | BPR Loss |

#### **3.5.4 Advantages**

* **Efficient Graph Propagation:** avoids redundant transformation layers.
* **Superior performance on sparse datasets.**
* **Strong generalization:** effectively captures high-order relations.
* Outperformed all other models in Recall and NDCG metrics.

---

### **3.6 Unified Training and Evaluation Pipeline**

A unified **Trainer class** manages all models:

```python
class Trainer:
    def __init__(self, model, optimizer, loss_fn, dataloader):
        ...
    def train(self, epochs):
        for batch in dataloader:
            loss = self.loss_fn(model(batch))
            loss.backward()
            optimizer.step()
```

**Evaluation Metrics (GitHub-friendly format):**

* **Recall@K** = (Number of relevant items in top K) / (Total relevant items)
* **NDCG@K** = *Σ (1 / log2(rank + 1)) / Ideal DCG*
* **Precision@K** = (Relevant items in top K) / K

---

# **Chapter 4. Experimental Results and Performance Analysis**

---

### **4.1 Evaluation Metrics**

To ensure a fair and reproducible comparison among all four models, the following evaluation metrics were adopted. These metrics assess both the **ranking quality** and **user satisfaction** of the recommendation results.

* **Recall@K**
  Measures the fraction of relevant items that are successfully retrieved among the top K recommendations.

  ```
  Recall@K = (Number of relevant items in top K) / (Total number of relevant items)
  ```

* **NDCG@K (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)**
  Evaluates ranking quality by assigning higher importance to relevant items appearing earlier in the list.

  ```
  NDCG@K = DCG@K / IDCG@K
  DCG@K = Σ (1 / log2(rank + 1))
  ```

* **Precision@K**
  Indicates the proportion of retrieved items that are truly relevant.

  ```
  Precision@K = (Relevant items in top K) / K
  ```

* **AUC (Area Under ROC Curve)**
  Captures the model’s ability to correctly rank positive samples higher than negative ones.

All metrics were computed using the **same test set** and evaluated over 10 random seeds to ensure robustness.

| Evaluation Metrics             | Recall@10, NDCG@10          |
| Hardware                       | NVIDIA RTX 3090 (24GB VRAM) |
| Framework                      | PyTorch 2.0                 |

All experiments were executed using a **unified training pipeline**, ensuring that differences in outcomes reflect the models themselves rather than discrepancies in data or evaluation logic.

---

* **BPRMF** balances speed and accuracy.
* **DeepFM** trades speed for richer feature interaction.
* **LightGCN** offers the best trade-off between computational cost and recommendation quality.

---

### **4.7 Error and Bias Analysis**

1. **Popularity Bias**
   All models exhibit a bias toward popular items; LightGCN alleviates this partially by graph propagation over less-connected nodes.

2. **Cold Start Problem**
   ItemKNN and BPRMF perform poorly on new users/items, while DeepFM mitigates this using feature embeddings.

3. **Long-tail Coverage**
   Graph-based propagation in LightGCN improved long-tail item coverage by ~8% compared to BPRMF.

4. **Overfitting Risk**
   DeepFM required dropout (0.5) and early stopping to prevent memorizing frequent co-occurrences.

---

# **Chapter 5. Optimization Strategies and Application Scenarios**

---

### **5.1 Optimization Objectives**

After initial model evaluation, several optimization objectives were defined to improve both accuracy and computational efficiency:

1. **Enhance Recall and NDCG scores** through hyperparameter fine-tuning.
2. **Reduce training cost** without compromising convergence.
3. **Mitigate popularity bias** and improve coverage for long-tail items.
4. **Enable deployment flexibility** for large-scale industrial recommendation systems.

These optimizations were conducted across **BPRMF**, **ItemKNN**, **DeepFM**, and **LightGCN**, ensuring fairness through consistent evaluation pipelines.

---

### **5.2 Model-level Optimization Strategies**
